# PHP 7

## The `<?php ?>` tag:
- Should enclose PHP code with `<?php ?>`.
- Any code outside `<?php ?>` are interpreted as it is.
- Any HTML outside `<?php ?>` are interpreted by the browser.

### Exanmple:
```
<?php
echo 'hello world';
?>
bye world
```

The above code will print both `hello world` and `bye world`.

## Comment:

- PHP supports two types of comment - single-line comments and multiple-line comments.

### Example:
```
// This is the single-line comments

/*
  This is the multiple-line comments.
  second line.
*/
```
